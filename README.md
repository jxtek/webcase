# The Greatbone Framework  

As in 1990's, dBase had let many people become highly productive programmers, by its simple working environment and powerful data operability.

* use up of advanced open source technologies, such as .Net Core, PostgreSQL, SQLite 
* supports of common architectural design patterns

* lightweight while battery-included -- live well without thridparties such as Radis or Kafka
* high-performance -- esp on multi-core boxes

We're aiming similar goals to create a framework for building microservices, that is
* reliable -- based on [.NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/core) and [PostgresSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
* lightweight while battery-included -- live well without thridparties such as Radis or Kafka
* high-performance -- esp on multi-core boxes
* extremely optimized caching -- both client and server caches lead to many many times less network traffic and database access
* data handling and operation are unified and way direct -- no extra layers
* much less coding -- a couple of guys may cope with large projects 
* versatile -- good for from small management systems to large-scale e-commerce platforms.
