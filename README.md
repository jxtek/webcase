# Welcome to WebReady  

WebReady is an extensible webapp framework that exposes well-designed database objects directly as RESTful web services.

WebReady is based on the high-performance [Kestral HTTP server](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/tree/master/src/Servers/Kestrel) that is built in ASP.NET Core, as well as the [Npgsql data access library](https://www.npgsql.org/).
